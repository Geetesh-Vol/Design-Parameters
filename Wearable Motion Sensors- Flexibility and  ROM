FLexibility and ROM
Use Case: Rehabilitation, Sports Performance, and Injury Prevention

Sensors Used:
Inertial Measurement Units (IMUs): Combines accelerometers, gyroscopes, and magnetometers for precise motion tracking.
Flex Sensors: Measures joint angles and bending movements for ROM analysis.
Electrogoniometers: Tracks joint movement in real-time for clinical-grade accuracy.
Smart Clothing with Embedded Sensors: Detects muscle activation and limb movement to assess flexibility.

3. Key Benefits of Wearable Motion Sensors for Flexibility & ROM
✅ Objective & Quantifiable Data – Eliminates subjective assessments, providing precise mobility metrics.
✅ Real-Time Feedback – Alerts users on restricted movement or poor flexibility patterns.
✅ Personalized Training & Rehab Plans – AI-driven insights tailor stretches and corrective exercises.
✅ Long-Term Tracking – Helps monitor flexibility improvements over weeks or months.
✅ Prevents Injuries – Detects ROM imbalances that may lead to joint strain or muscle tightness.

4. Potential Limitations
⚠ Sensor Placement Matters – Needs to be properly placed on joints for accurate readings.
⚠ Limited Full-Body Coverage Without Multiple Sensors – More sensors are required for comprehensive flexibility tracking.
⚠ Cost Factor – Clinical-grade motion sensors (e.g., Xsens) are expensive ($500–$5,000).
⚠ User Compliance – Users must wear the sensors correctly and follow movement guidelines.
